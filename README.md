# Algorithm DS in JS

Algorithms JS repository implements different Data Structures and eventually different algorithms in JavaScript.

<!-- Body -->

Algorithms implemented in this repository are just based on personal inspiration. I will update this ReadMe with new algorithms and data structures that are added as time goes on

<!-- Data Structures -->

- **Data Structures**
  - **Linked-Lists**
    - [Singly-Linked-List](Linked-Lists/single-linked-list.js)
    - [Doubly-Linked-List](Linked-Lists/double-linked-list.js)
  - Queue
    - [Queue-Arr](Queue/Queue.js)
    - [Queue-Linked-List](Queue/QueueLL.js)
  - Stack
    - [Stack-Arr](Stack/stack.js)
  - Binary Trees
